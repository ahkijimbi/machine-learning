# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My journey into Machine Learning.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a set of techniques, which help in dealing with vast data in the most intelligent fashion (by developing algorithms or set of logical rules) to derive actionable insights

Machine Learning driven by strong fundamentals - Loads of data emitted by sensor with cheap storage and lowest ever computations costs!

Some technical words used with machine :
Statistics , Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Data Mining

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI refers to the procedure of programming a computer (machine) to take rational
```
Rational is the basis of taking a decision.
```

## Statistics
Statistics is that branch of mathematics which utilizes data.

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is associated with a machine learning algorithm (Artificial Neural Network, ANN) which uses the concept of human brain to facilitate the modeling of arbitrary functions. ANN requires a vast amount of data and this algorithm is highly flexible when it comes to model multiple outputs simultaneously.

## Data Mining
Data Mining deals with searching specific information.

## How do we teach machines
The process of teaching machines breaks down into 3 parts:
```
1. Data as input
2. Abstract the data
3. Generalization
```

## Steps used in machine learning
There are 5 basic stpes used to perform a machine learning task:
```
1. Collecting data
2.Preparing the data
3. Training a model
4. Evaluating the model
5. Improving the performance
```

## Types of machine learning
```
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement learning
```
